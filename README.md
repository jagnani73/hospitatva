# üí° Problem Statement

During Covid ‚Äì 19 crisis, many private hospitals had charged huge and unimaginable amounts from patients and made enormous profits taking advantage of panic conditions. Notwithstanding of spending huge amounts many families lost their members and in some instances hospitals even demanded clearance of pending bills for handing over bodies to their families. There was no proper information about availability of beds and details of treatment provided etc. In order to curb this exploitation by private hospitals, there is a requirement of national information portal which can regulate all the private hospitals and provide accurate details of rates and medical facilities available in the private hospitals across the country to guide the citizens to get affordable medical emergency services as per their choice and availability.

<br>

# üß† Knowledge Primer

A distributed ledger-based blockchain implementation of the rates proposed and charged, and the commodity count by hospitals for treatment and consultancy of patients. We aim to make the fair prices of medical commodities publicly available aggregating real-time data from multiple sources. We also aim to make the medical inventory available in the hospital public. This will prevent, if not eradicate the exploitation done by private hospitals charging its patients for the services offered.

- There are three portals namely the **Patient** _(Public)_, **Management** _(Hospitals)_, **Government** _(Supervisors)_ portals.
  - The _Patients'_ portal can be used to get a list of the hospitals, and their details, including their inventory with the availability, and the price. They can then as per their need book a session and get the digital invoice here itself. The invoice has comparison for the government recommended price and enables flagging options incase of an anomaly.
  - The _Managements'_ portal is where every hospitals' staff and management can perform an inventory check.
  - The _Governments'_ portal is where the officials receive the flagged queries and can supervise whether it is legitimate or a spam.
